// Shadowing 
// Shadowing is different from marking a variable as mut, 
// because weâ€™ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the let keyword. 
// By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
